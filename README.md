# Project Description 
This project is solely based on how to make fried rice . However , we try to tell a story through the process. The story of this project is based on a character who tries to impress his crush with his cooking skills . We first had a wide variety of ideas to choose from but we settled on this as it also would allow for some interactivity in our website. We try to involve the user as much as we can by letting the user choose the steps one has to follow in making fried rice. We also allow an option of whether the fried rice should be spicy or not and we show the user how the fried rice turned out to be in the process.  I will definitely say we were able to achieve most or implement most of our ideas . However , there were a few changes along the way where we had to opt for another method which wasn't a part of our original idea. This occurred during the shooting process and the editing process. However , we were able to make a good movie out of the shots that we had.

# Process 

We first had to shoot the scenes of the video which was approximately 60 scenes and we had to choose the best among them . After that we edited the scenes together to make one whole movie and added background music along the line.  The website has a pretty basic layout in order to allow for the user to focus more on the content. However , we try as much as possible to get the user's eye hooked to the video as the user interacts with the website at a point in time. The website starts with the homepage where the title is displayed . After that , the user is able to watch the intro of the video which is basically the character inviting his crush over to cook fried rice for her . After that , the user is allowed to choose the steps in making a fried rice and also has the option of making it spicy or not . Depending on the selection of the user , we show a video with the exact process the user selected and also show the final outcome of how the food turned out to be (whether the crush liked it or not ) . The last part of the website is the credits session where we acknowledge people who worked on the project.


# Reflection/Evaluation

Our initial concept and the outcome of the project had a little difference. We were able to stick to the theme of our project and follow the scripts and scenes we made . The only changes that were made had to do with recording some of the scenes and audios twice since they were not really clear or audible .  Our expectations and goals were met throughout the process , however it definitely required a lot of time editing and putting everything together.However , we enjoyed the whole process of shooting the scenes and making the website and it is definitely a worthwhile experience .


Special thanks to our actors Prince and Shumin, our editor Nouf and the director, which happens to be myself, for the time dedicated to work on this project.
